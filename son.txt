According to Dr. Rosina on "Rise and Shine : I'm a parenting expert - the reason
why kids take so long to get ready for school and how to make the morning a
breeze.", there are many different reasons for why kids might drag out getting
ready for school, but the main thing to remember is that it's completely normal.

Reason 1 - Many children don't have the same sense of time or urgency as adult
          do. Since parents tend to hurry their children for school, the child-
          ren themselves don't sense the urgency.

Reason 2 - Being obsessed or addicted to something can cause children to proca-
          stinate or even completely put off getting ready for school. This is
          mostly observed in teenagers but can also be found in kids and young
          adults.

Reason 3 - Avoidance or unwillingness. Just like adults, children and teenagers
          may prolong their tasks to avoid going to school or work.

Reason 4 - They are tired! As many teenagers and adults go to bed late at night
          due to reasons such as work, games, reading, or even just simply
          spending time on social media. Since they go to bed late, the also
          get up late.

Your son could be getting up late for reasons above or it could something
entirely different. It is best to discuss it first with that person in question,
and then work towards finding a solution. Most common solutions for the reasons
mentioned above is a Schedule that utilizes time management to help one stay
organized and work efficiently.
