Being organized and efficient is a not something humans naturally have, it is
a skill that one must develop. Although we all have different ways of learning
or methods that work for us, scheduling has proved to be a flexible option for
most people. This is because time management increases efficiency.

Below is a schedule maker that the client / user can use to express their expec-

It is also important to remember that making a good schedule for someone takes
time. It is a process of trial and error. We must try different schedules and
experience them one-by-one to find the most suitable option.
